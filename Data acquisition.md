# Data acquisition
data acquisition of NMR และ LC-MS 

1. Sample Preparation: Start by preparing the fermented fish samples according to the experimental design and research objectives. Ensure that the samples are representative and properly labeled for identification during data analysis.
2. Sample Extraction: Extract the metabolites from the fermented fish samples using an appropriate extraction method. The extraction protocols may differ for NMR and LC-MS analysis, so it is important to optimize the extraction conditions for each technique. Commonly used extraction solvents for both techniques include mixtures of water, methanol, and chloroform.
3. Sample Cleanup (if required): Depending on the complexity of the sample matrix and the desired analysis, additional cleanup steps may be necessary. This can involve techniques such as solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) to remove interfering compounds and concentrate the metabolites. The cleanup steps may vary for NMR and LC-MS analysis, so it is important to consider the specific requirements of each technique.
4. NMR Sample Preparation: Transfer the extracted and optionally cleaned-up metabolites into NMR tubes. Ensure that the NMR tubes are clean and free from any contaminants that may interfere with the spectral quality. The volume and concentration of the NMR sample should be optimized to obtain high-quality spectra.
5. NMR Instrument Setup: Set up the NMR instrument according to the specific experimental requirements. Ensure that the instrument is properly calibrated and optimized for the analysis of the sample type and the desired metabolite detection. Input the necessary parameters for the NMR experiment, such as pulse sequences, acquisition time, relaxation delays, and spectral width.
6. NMR Data Acquisition: Perform the data acquisition by irradiating the NMR sample with radiofrequency pulses and recording the resulting NMR signals. Acquire 1D proton (1H) NMR spectra and, if necessary, consider acquiring additional multidimensional NMR experiments to enhance spectral resolution and metabolite identification.
7. LC-MS Instrument Setup: Set up the LC-MS instrument according to the specific experimental requirements. This includes selecting the appropriate LC column, mobile phase composition, flow rate, and gradient program. Configure the MS instrument for the desired ionization mode (e.g., electrospray ionization, ESI) and adjust the MS parameters, such as ionization voltage, ion source temperature, and mass analyzer settings.
8. LC-MS Data Acquisition: Inject the prepared samples into the LC system for separation. The LC column will separate the metabolites based on their physicochemical properties. The eluting metabolites are then introduced into the MS system for detection. Acquire data in both full scan mode and targeted mode, if applicable, to obtain comprehensive metabolite profiles and enable the identification of specific metabolites of interest.
9. Data Processing: Process the acquired NMR and LC-MS data using appropriate software. For NMR data, perform Fourier transformation of the time-domain NMR signals to obtain frequency-domain spectra. Additional processing steps may include baseline correction, phase correction, and referencing to a known internal or external standard. For LC-MS data, convert the raw data into a usable format and perform peak picking, deconvolution, alignment, and normalization to correct for variations in sample concentration and instrument response.
10. Data Analysis: Analyze the processed NMR and LC-MS data using various methods, such as peak picking, integration, feature extraction, and statistical analysis. Compare the metabolite profiles between different fermentation time points or conditions to identify changes in metabolite abundance. Perform statistical analysis, such as univariate or multivariate analysis, to identify significant metabolite changes and correlations with fermentation time points or odor satisfaction.
11. Metabolite Identification: Assign the peaks or features in the NMR and LC-MS spectra to specific metabolites using databases, reference standards, or in silico methods. Verify the metabolite assignments using two-dimensional NMR experiments, MS/MS fragmentation patterns, or through spiking experiments with pure standards.
